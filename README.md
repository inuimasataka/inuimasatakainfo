### 4.1 Goal: For a compassionate world

To reveal late Tantric Buddhism, especially how the lineage, the teachings, and the practices were inherited in the Gelug school in Tibet, based on the methodologies of Buddhist studies and other studies related to the human mind.


### 4.2 Contribution

As Buddhist studies deal with a multilingual and pan-Asian scope, I believe that Buddhist studies will enable us 

 #### (1) to contribute to the construction of a basis for dialogue in the Asian world. 

Furthermore, as Japanese thought is greatly influenced by Buddhism, Buddhist studies enable us

 #### (2) to contribute to the continuous renewal of our understanding of Japan. 

Moreover, as Buddhism is a religion with the motivation to realise the happiness of all living beings, I believe that Buddhist studies at least enables us

 #### (3) to contribute to the realisation of a peaceful and stable spirit in mankind. 

My research must be motivated by a commitment to these contributions to humanity.

## 5. For a compassionate world.

I take refuge in the Three Treasures.

### 5.1 My duties
Based on my self-identification as a human being living in Japan, educated at the beginning of the 21st century, practising Buddhism and studying Buddhist studies, I consider that I am responsible for the following:

(1) To contribute to the construction of a basis for dialogue in the Asian world.
(2) To contribute to the continuous renewal of our understanding of Japan.
(3) To contribute to the realisation of a peaceful and stable spirit in mankind.

With regard to these, the following explanations are given.

(1) Buddhism has spread throughout the Asian world over the history of the religion and has provided a certain degree of common values that transcend language and nation. However, it is not certain to what extent Buddhist values such as compassion have contributed to peace and the well-being of people in the Asian world. Furthermore, it is not realistic to think that these historical conditions can be immediately revived in the present. 

However, we intuit that the Buddhist idea of compassion, of being close to the weak, to all human beings and to all living things, of finding the power of goodness in them and bringing them comfort, brings something more peaceful than the opposite values of intolerance, exclusion, deception and contempt. 

Furthermore, Buddhist studies has responded to this multilingual nature of Buddhism by developing research methodologies that address ideological issues that span multiple languages and other regions. These are adaptable to other pan-Asian disciplines and can contribute to a pan-Asian framework of scholarship and dialogue when the methodological foundations of Buddhist studies have been further examined and can withstand criticism from other disciplines.

(2) Buddhism has spread throughout the Asian world, including Japan. When it comes to understanding Japanese thought, an understanding of Buddhist thought holds an important position. Buddhism is an essential part of Japanese studies. 

The question of why Japanese studies is important must be answered here. It is because Japan is a spacetime that defines the people who inhabit Japan. By residing in a place called Japan, the inhabitant is defined by something Japanese. It is impossible to escape from this regulation, but if, as a researcher, one does not have some ability to grasp and relativise the ideological environment that defines oneself, it is possible that the significance of one's research will be limited in time and space by a parochial consciousness based on the spirit of the times or the regional spirit.

As a person living in Japan, Japanese studies is also important in terms of relativising one's own thought environment when conducting Buddhist studies. 

Furthermore, I believe that by understanding Japan and renewing our view of Japan, specifically by bringing together academic knowledge on Japan, and by the emergence of a new narrative on Japan (Japan as self-understanding), it is possible to softly guide Japan in a positive direction. Although the pros and cons of academic studies dealing with such practical issues must be discussed, we believe that such a practical academic image is relatively easy to be realised in the form of a narrative about Japan.

(3) Buddhism is a religion of the mind. It is a religion that recognises the maximum potential for goodness in the hearts of all beings, and that seeks to guarantee to all beings the assurance of goodness in their hearts, goodness in their deeds, and enjoyment and happiness as the result of good karma. 

Just as we have various forms of security, it is not unnatural that the concept of spiritual security is presented and oriented towards the spiritual stability of humanity. At a time when the planet is becoming increasingly difficult for mankind to survive from multiple perspectives, and mass deaths such as wars and disasters are familiar events, the construction of academic knowledge on the spiritual crisis of mankind needs to be hastened. 

In this context, it must be acknowledged that it is indeed necessary to bring together academic knowledge related to the spiritual security of mankind. Buddhist studies, by the very nature of Buddhism, which is the subject of its research, is a study of the mind, and I think it is necessary to actively participate in this. 

As a Buddhist, I personally feel that I have the ability and the responsibility to be involved in these issues.

As a Buddhist born in Japan in the 21st century, I believe that I am committed to the above-mentioned responsibilities. As a person who has assumed a certain position, willingly or unwillingly, I believe that all the prosperity that comes with that position should be spent on making some contribution to others and to the world. 

This duty is outlined by the Bodhisattva or altruistic philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. I believe myself that all my activities and plans must be based on my self-identification as a Buddhist in this way.

### 5.2 My contributions

Considering that Buddhism is a religion that brings about good transformations in the minds of all beings (sems can) according to the nature of their feelings and the nature of all living beings, and promotes good deeds and happiness, it is the responsibility of Buddhists to realise the peace of all sentiments through the study of Buddhism. 

Buddhism has many phases, such as thought, logic, practice and bodhi, each of which needs to be examined carefully in terms of literature and precisely in terms of thought.

As a Buddhist, the end point of my research is to describe a state of mind that seems to me to be comfortable for all sentiments, and to suggest a path to that state of mind. It is a kind of spiritual security. At the same time, through this, the world will become more compassionate and we will succeed in building peace.

Since Buddhism has thought of a methodology for this, and since one of the quickest of these methodologies is the tantric tradition, in particular the tradition of the Yogānuttaratantra (rnal ʼbyor bla na med paʼi rgyud), those who study it will be able to contribute to this realisation. It seems natural that those who study it would have the idea that they could contribute to this realisation, and thus contribute to its planning. This end point could be related to fields such as medical science or neurology. This plan will take a considerable number of years, but if it succeeds, we believe that the situation surrounding the human psyche will at least be improved.

Now, specifically, in addition to an exploration of the Yogānuttaratantra texts themselves, which can be traced back to India, I would like to study how they have been interpreted, transmitted and practised in Tibet. In particular, the state of tantric Buddhism, including the doctrines and practices of Je Tsongkhapa Lobsang Trakpa (rje tsong kha pa blo bzang grags pa), his disciples and the Gelug school (dge lugs pa) up to the present day. 

The framework of the Gelug school, in terms of systematising all thought and practice as a way to attain Buddhahood, would place guhyasamajatantra (gsang 'dus) at its centre; guhyasamājatantra or cakrasaṃvaratantra (bde mchog) and other two steps (rim pa gnyis) in the tradition of the Yogānuttaratantra, which I want to study while reading the canonical texts and practising them.

Fortunately, I have received the fourfold perfection of guhyasamājatantra from a Gelug school acharya, and I practice the practice called sādhana (sgrub thams) every day and educated in a monastic way under the tradition of Gyudmed Monastery (rgyud smad grwa tsang). 

From the practitioner's perspective, the motivation for engaging in rnal ʼbyor bla na med paʼi rgyud  is very much related to the question of attaining Buddhahood.

If there is a superiority or inferiority of Buddhist thought, the idea that the Mahayana is superior to the Small Vehicle is fairly common within the Mahayana. The reason for this is the broadness of the object of salvation. 

On the other hand, when comparing Mahayana and Tantric Buddhism, the superiority of Tantric Buddhism is not a matter of the broadness of the object of salvation. Both aim to save all sentient beings. Tantric Buddhism is considered superior mainly because of the short time it takes to attain Buddhahood, symbolised by the term 'Sokushin Jōbutsu (即身成仏)'(immediate attainment of Buddhahood) in Japanese Tantric Buddhism.

The Yogānuttaratantra, which is praised as bla na med pa (there is nothing better than this, nothing better than this), is considered superior because of the short time it takes to attain Buddhahood, and in particular because of its ability to unite life, death, mediumship and phases in meditation (skye shi bar do gsums dang rnam pa mthun par sgom pa), etc., as its important advantages. The idea that a person who wishes for speedy attainment of Buddhahood would not take this path of practice is not viable. Therefore, I am practising the path of Yogānuttaratantra because I find it wonderful. This religious motivation also drives my study of Yogānuttaratantra.

In addition, considering that I myself am a monk and practising on Mt. Koya-san, my perspective as a Shingon monk naturally comes into use in these studies of esoteric Buddhism.Even when it comes to the same mid-temperate esoteric texts, thought and practice differ between Japan and Tibet. These comparisons can also be an interesting topic. 

Furthermore, living in a monastery where Buddhism is actually practised helps to understand what Buddhism is all about. Therefore, in addition to literary research, I consider it essential to study in a Tibetan monastery, receive transmission related to tantric Buddhism, and study in a way that unites practice and teaching in order to understand tantric Buddhism.

Now, my research topics may be summarised as follows.

(1) To reveal how late esoteric teachings, or the tradition known as rnal ʼbyor bla na med paʼi rgyud in Tibet, such as guhyasamājatantra and cakrasaṃvaratantra has been handed down in dGe lugs pa (Geluk school) from multiple perspectives, such as thought and practice. In addition, its success or failure must be evaluated from the perspective of whether or not it contributes to the attainment of Buddhahood.

(2) In order to fully conduct the research above, it is necessary to examine how logic has been formed and utilised in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism in writing the texts, and how the view of stong pa nyid (emptiness) has been developed in the Indian Buddhist philosophical schools, including the school of Prasaṅgika (dbu ma thal 'gyur pa), view how they were understood and how they were accepted, interpreted and passed on by Tibetan Buddhist monks, especially how they were utilised in Tantric practice.

(3) To build up a database of the texts represented by the Three Treasury Books and the audio recordings of the lectures of the high priests of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism in order to carry out the above research to the fullest extent.


(4) To widely integrate the above studies with the knowledge of other religions, literature, art, history, society, life and death and other spiritual activities of mankind, and to analyse spirituality and its narratives that precede religion, and to seek ways of solidarity, dialogue and cooperation among human beings beyond religion and thought, as well as happiness, suffering and care, and to explore the relationship between spiritual states such as happiness, suffering and care, which human beings can satisfy through mutual relationships, and individual states of mind such as compassion and altruism, and to propose a state of human society that is considered to be happy for each of them.

(5) Through the above research, to consider how the way of understanding the human body and mind based on the tradition of Yogānuttaratantra can or cannot be described by the findings of modern science such as medical science and neurology, and, based on this consideration, to develop a method of spiritual security using the method of Yogānuttaratantra practice.

(6) With the above, to investigate the diversity and inclusive environment of the Indo-Pacific and local Buddhist worlds, especially the inclusive environment surrounding dialogue and thought, and to contribute to the peace-building of future human society from the perspective of language, dialogue, logic, law, philosophy, thought and spirituality. 

### 5.3 Conclusion

It is clear that in order to achieve the directions and goals outlined above, I will have to continue my studies and training even further. It goes without saying that I also need the guidance of my teachers and the advice and help of my friends and colleagues. All collaborators in the project must also overcome any mediocrity and work together in the face of difficulties. However, I believe that the benefits of achieving this will be a great fruit for humanity and humanity's future.

I have managed to continue my studies to this day. This is due to the guidance and support of my parents, Geshes (dge bshes), teachers, friends, seniors, juniors, donors, the state, universities, temples, and others. We believe that this site fulfils my accountability to these supporters. 

In the future, I would like to return the favour of these people in all areas. Although I am not perfect in many respects, including my studies, research and personality, I would like to ask for your continued warm support.

I also pray that you may live in a place of peace, free from all hindrances, in good health, with an improved life expectancy and full of good fortune. With these prayers, I offer you my best wishes.

Sincerely,
